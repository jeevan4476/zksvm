# ZKSVM Rollup

A general-purpose zero-knowledge rollup built on Solana's SVM (Solana Virtual Machine) for generating and verifying cryptographic proofs on-chain.

## Overview

ZKSVM is a research-oriented rollup implementation that leverages Solana's SVM API to create a scalable, proof-generating rollup system. The project focuses on benchmarking zero-knowledge proofs (SNARKs) on SVM as part of ongoing research into efficient blockchain scaling solutions.

## Architecture

![Zelana Diagram](assets/images/zksvm-diagram.png)

The rollup consists of two main components:

### Rollup Core (`rollup_core/`)
The core rollup implementation that handles:
- **Sequencer**: Processes and batches transactions
- **RollupDB**: Manages account state and transaction storage
- **Frontend**: HTTP API for transaction submission and retrieval
- **Settlement**: Handles proof generation and on-chain verification

### Rollup Client (`rollup_client/`)
A client library for interacting with the rollup, providing:
- Transaction submission
- State querying
- Proof verification

## Tech Stack

### Core Dependencies
- **Solana SVM API**: `solana-svm = "2.0.7"`
- **Solana Runtime**: `solana-program-runtime = "2.0.7"`
- **Solana SDK**: `solana-sdk = "2.0.7"`
- **Solana Client**: `solana-client = "2.0.7"`
- **Compute Budget**: `solana-compute-budget = "2.0.7"`
- **BPF Loader**: `solana-bpf-loader-program = "2.0.7"`

### Web Framework
- **Actix Web**: High-performance async web framework
- **Tokio**: Async runtime for Rust

### Zero-Knowledge Integration
The project integrates with:
- **Light Protocol SVM**: For advanced zero-knowledge capabilities
- **Groth16-Solana**: For efficient SNARK proof generation
- **Ark-ff**: Prime field arithmetic for cryptographic operations
- **BN254**: Elliptic curve operations for pairing-based cryptography

```rust
use crate::errors::Groth16Error;
use ark_ff::PrimeField;
use num_bigint::BigUint;
use solana_bn254::prelude::{
    alt_bn128_addition, 
    alt_bn128_multiplication, 
    alt_bn128_pairing
};
```

## Why ZKSVM Rollup?

### Research Objectives
1. **SNARK Benchmarking**: Evaluate performance of zero-knowledge proofs on SVM
2. **Scalability Research**: Study efficient rollup architectures for blockchain scaling
3. **Proof Generation**: Develop optimized proof generation pipelines
4. **On-chain Verification**: Implement efficient on-chain proof verification

### Key Benefits
- **General Purpose**: Supports arbitrary Solana programs and transactions
- **SVM Native**: Leverages Solana's battle-tested virtual machine
- **Research Platform**: Designed for benchmarking and experimentation
- **Modular Architecture**: Separates concerns between core, client, and proof systems

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Rust 1.70+ with Cargo
- Solana CLI tools
- Access to Solana devnet/mainnet

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd zksvm
```

2. Build the rollup core:
```bash
cd rollup_core
cargo build --release
```

3. Build the rollup client:
```bash
cd ../rollup_client
cargo build --release
```

### Running the Rollup

1. Start the rollup core server:
```bash
cd rollup_core
cargo run --release
```

The server will start on `http://localhost:8080` with the following endpoints:
- `GET /`: Health check
- `POST /submit_transaction`: Submit a transaction to the rollup
- `POST /get_transaction`: Retrieve transaction status

2. Use the client to interact with the rollup:
```bash
cd rollup_client
cargo run --release
```

## API Endpoints

### Submit Transaction
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/submit_transaction \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "transaction": "base64_encoded_transaction"
  }'
```

### Get Transaction
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/get_transaction \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "signature": "transaction_signature"
  }'
```
